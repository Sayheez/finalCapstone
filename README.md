HyperionDev-Task-32: This project is Task 32 of the hyperionDev Software Engineering bootcamp set of tasks.

This is a Capstone Project and is about a store having a file for storing, viewing, and retrieving information about shoes available in the store
The purpose of this project is to understand how object oriented programming - classes and objects are vital to the solving real world problems. This task made use of real world data.

Functionality: The user is requested input any of the following below menu:
1 - add a shoe
2 - view all shoes
3 - restock shoes needed
4 - search all shoes
5 - get value per item
6 - display the highest quality of shoes
e - exit

Only if the user is logged in as admin can they register a new user. The Admin user is also given the option to view all the program statistics before the main menu is displayed.

If user selects 1, they can add a shoe to the text file with all necessary details about the shoe.

If the user enters '2' for view all shoes, all the shoes in the text file are displayed in a top-down approach that gives details of each shoe.

If the user enters '3', they can restock any shoe that is found to be of low quantity in the text file(inventory.txt).

If the user enters '4', all the shoes in the inventory.txt can be search to find a particular shoe inputted by the user if it is available.

If the user enters '5', it display the value per item of each shoe in the the inventory.txt.

If the user enters '6', it display the highest quantity that is yet to be sold in the inventory.txt.

If the user enters 'e', it exit the program
Usefulness: This Python project is useful because it indicates that small /a small company can set up this to monitor their stocks in real time.
